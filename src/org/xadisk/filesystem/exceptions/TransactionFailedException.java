/**
 * This exception is an unchecked exception thrown when a transaction is not able to
 * continue its work and is left in an inconsistent incomplete state. That is, the
 * transaction did not commit or rollback and will require an administrative
 * intervention for resolving inconsistency and then marking the transaction as
 * complete. A transaction can fail either during routine XADisk operations or
 * during the recovery phase of XADisk. For the routine cases, the
 * transaction will keep holding the locks (in-memory) over files/directories until
 * it is marked complete.
 *
 * <p> If a transaction fails during recovery (when xadisk is committing or rolling-back
 * the transactions running prior to the reboot), the recovery process will wait until
 * all these failed transactions are marked complete.
 *
 * <p> A failed transaction can be marked complete using
 * {@link XAFileSystem#declareTransactionAsComplete(byte[])}. The identifier for such
 * transaction can be obtained either from {@link #getTransactionIdentifier()}, or
 * {@link XAFileSystem#getIdentifiersForFailedTransactions()}.
 * 
 * <p> This exception is not expected to occur in general, and indicates a severe problem.
 *
 * @since 1.2.2
